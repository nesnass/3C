# Brief

Investigating the use of information technology to improve participation in the city planning process.

Various stakeholder groups use Instagram as a source of input for ideas and inspiration, contributing to discussion on planning in their local city area. Experts respond alike, and in this way we hope to improve participation and transparency in city planning process.

# Introduction

Co-constructing city futures (3C) is a Norwegian collaboration between Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Norwegian Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen), Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU), Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), and the Department of Education, University of Oslo. We aim to investigate the use of information technology to improve participation in the city planning process.

# Technology

Utilising social media, we are attempting to create 'low threshold' avenues that encourage stakeholders who might otherwise feel reluctant to participate. That means allowing regular users of public spaces to post ideas and inspiration into a collection using readily available and commonly held tools, such as Instagram and MMS. 
The audience is broad including the general public, politicians, architects, and other expert groups.

Our service will combine contribution channels and complement the gathered data with features such as localisation, prioritisation, sub-categorisation and also interactions such as voting or discussion, with views on the data presentable in different contexts such as public spaces, stakeholder offices or the local government web site.



# Operation with Instagram

Posts to Instagram must include a specific hashtag that will be combined with results collected from other sources. In any view presented, each post will be properly attributed with its original owner's details.

Our first project involves the re-development of Norwegian University of Science and Technology city campus in Trondheim, working with both the university and Trondheim City Council. Thus the hashtag will be  #framtidscampus
Specific details of that planning project can be found here:  http://www.bycampus.no

We see 3C's use of Instagram falling within multiple categories:
	'helping advertisers understand and manage their audience'
	Where 'advertisers' describe the expert groups such as architects and politicians

and
	'helps broadcasters and publishers discover content'
 	Where 'broadcasters' include all of stakeholders involved.

Overall, Instagram posts can express a rich opinion about the planning process that is more valuable than text alone.


This design is intended to be used across multiple projects and has an intrinsic need for access to public content. Though we are currently in a development phase, the project relies heavily on input from multiple, varied users to provide real meaning. Entering as we are in the midst of the NTNU planning timeline, our work will develop alongside it.

The presentation of material at present is limited to a time-ordered list of owner attributed images that match the hashtag #framtidscampus.
